// Use @State for simple properties that belong to a single view. They should usually be marked private.
// Use $ before a property for two-way bindings. The view can read this property and the user can write it.
// Use @ObservedObject for complex properties that might belong to several views. Most times youâ€™re using a reference type.
// Use @StateObject once for each observable object you use, in whichever part of your code is responsible for creating it.
// Use @EnvironmentObject for properties that were created elsewhere in the app, such as public shared data.
// @Published is attached to properties, and refreshes any views that use this property when it is changed.
